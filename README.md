## OEC Overview
OEC (Ontario Engineering Competition) is a provincial wide competition with various engineering categories such as re-engineering, design, programming etc.

## Problem statement
The problem was to find the optimal path that a plastic collecting vehicle can take while minimizing plastic lost and distance travelled while keeping a QoR metric as low 

as possible. 

## Solution
Our solution was to pick up all the waste nodes first, find the best local sorting facility, best regional facility, then best regional recycling facility. Then have 

our vehicle drive to those facilities in that order.
